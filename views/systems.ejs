          <p>Longer is better!

          <p>Adding length to your hair is an instantaneous transformation to being a glamazon or Goddess.  </p>

          <p>The best part is, if that sexy bob you're sick of already or bad nasty cut isn't growing fast enough, let me bridge that gap for you. By strategically adding in several weft extensions to your natural hair you will now strut around with long, sexy, sleek layers (or  even color-infused ombre hair is possible in minutes.) </p>

          <p>Literally, in under a few hours, unbelievable transformation will happen. It's also a great way to create fashion-forward, trendy styles without compromising the integrity of your natural hair. </p>

          <p>Most of your natural hair is free, so your styling is endless. </p>

          <p>This versatile system allows fullness and heat protection for you scrumptious hair. </p>

          <p>This lovely style requires two follow-up maintenance appointments over the 12 weeks that the extension are in. This maintenance service is available for trims, reshaping, and weft reinforcement. Additional service fees apply. </p>

          <p>Several methods within this system are available:</p>

          <blockquote>Braid-in tracks are the most traditional method used.  A thin braid is placed horizontally in several sections of your natural hair. The weft hair of your choice is then sewn onto that braid. With several tracks added and the perfect blend cut, it is virtually impossible to see where your hair and the extensions meet.
          <br><strong>Starting at: $65/roll</strong>

          </div>

          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>Malaysian tracks are becoming pretty popular.  Copper silicone-lined beads are placed in rolls in the same manner in which the braid is created in the previous method. The wefts are then sewn onto the beads.   This gives the same result but lays noticeably flatter.  This method is ideal for clients with thinner hair or those who only wish to emphasize certain points in their style (i.e., A-line bobs or color placement).

          <blockquote>Clip-in wefts are perfect for special occasions, events, photo shoots, and weddings.  Often, when a client graduates from the LJ Mane haircare system, she is not always ready to give up the fullness that extensions give. The wefts that are removed can be made into clips.
